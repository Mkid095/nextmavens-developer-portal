Added comparison table showing NextMavens DB-Driven vs Custom Pub/Sub approaches. Added 'Why DB-Driven Realtime Wins' section explaining Single Source of Truth, Automatic Schema Evolution, and Built-in Reliability. Cross-link to /docs/realtime documentation. Updated 'comingSoon' flag to false for Realtime DB-Driven principle. Typecheck passes."

Added 'When to Use Which Provider' section comparing Telegram for raw file storage and long-term archiving vs Cloudinary for optimized web assets and media delivery. Added feature comparison table showing storage cost, max file size, CDN delivery, image optimization, and transformations. Added 'How It Works' step-by-step section explaining the unified API flow.
